        <p class="indent">Cosmopoint International Institute of Technology or CIIT is a school that provides
          exceptional education and prepares students for the 21st-century industry standards.
          CIIT Senior High School offers three strands, media and visual arts under the arts and
          design track. It leads to a bachelor of multimedia arts and a bachelor of fine arts, which
          focuses on multimedia arts such as graphic designing, photography, and drawing.
          Animation under the Tech Voc track- ICT strand leading to a bachelor of multimedia
          arts, this strang focuses on drawing techniques, graphic design, 3D modeling, and
          2D/3D animation. Computer Programming under Tech Voc track- ICT strand leading to
          a BS Computer Science or BS Entertainment Multimedia Computing, which focuses on
          programming, data structure and algorithms, game design, and game programming. All
          of the three Senior High School strands that CIIT offers are different from each other.
          Some aspects make them similar to each other like, their subjects (Core, Applied, and
          Specialization), College course crediting, and job internship (Possible Work Immersion
          Experience). The strands such as the media and visual arts, animation, and
          programming are very different. They cater to different types of people but, they still
          have a lot of similarities between them.
          </p>
        <p class="indent">CIIT Senior High School has three types of subjects; core, applied, and
          specialization subjects. The core and applied subjects belong to the DepEd's core
          curriculum, and the specializations subjects are part of the track/strand itself. Every
          strand has its differences and similarities when it comes to its subjects. The Media and
          Visual Arts strand specialization subjects consist of Introduction to Multimedia Arts,
          History of Graphic Design, Elements of Graphic Design, Digital Photography, Writing for
          New Media, Fundamentals of Film and Video Production, Multimedia Publishing. The
          subjects introduce students to the world of multimedia arts and teach them basic
          principles about multimedia arts. The Animation strand specialization subjects consist
          of; Traditional Animation, History of Graphic Design, Digital Animation, Introduction to
          Multimedia Arts, 2D Animation, Color Theory, 3D Modeling, and Typography and
          Layout. These subjects introduce animation strand students to the basic principles and
          techniques in animation, and the programming strand specialization subject consists of
          Introduction to Computing, Computer Programming 1 and 2, Data Structure, and
          Algorithm, Information Management, Object-Oriented Programming, Introduction to
          Game Design and Development, and Game Programming. The subjects introduce
          programming students to the basics of programming. The specialization subjects from
          the three strands are unique to each other. The specialization subjects from the media
          and visual arts strands focus more on multimedia as a whole with little to no drawing
          done. The animation strand is more focused on the animation and drawing itself. The
          programming strand's specializations subjects are completely different from the media
          and visual arts strand and the animation strand because it deals on computer
          programming rather than arts. There are also similarities between the strands offered by
          CIIT. All of the strands share the same core and applied subjects from DepEd's
          curriculum. The media and visual arts strand and the animation strand share three
          subjects; the History of Graphic Design, Introduction to Multimedia Arts, and Drawing 1
          in the first semester of Grade 11. All of the strands deal with some kind of designing in
          their subjects with graphic design for the media and visual arts and animation strands,
          and web design for the programming strand. Most of the subjects for programming and
          animation are technology-based subjects.
          </p>
        <p class="indent">The CIIT Senior High School specialization subjects are also taken up and
          studied in CIIT College. If a student had already taken and studied that subject in CIIT
          Senior High School, the student will no longer have to take and study that particular
          subject again. Instead, the student will get accredited for that subject if he/she will
          continue through College in CIIT. CIIT College offers 3 Bachelor programs, Bachelor of
          Multimedia Arts major in Major in Animation / Film and Video Production / Graphics
          Design, Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with Specialization in Web and
          Mobile Application Development, and Bachelor of Science in Entertainment and
          Multimedia Computing with specialization in Gamified System Development. The
          number of credits that can be accredited can vary from bachelor programs and majors.
          The Media and Visual Arts strand is the most versatile strand in terms of arts. All of the
          three majors of Bachelor of Multimedia Arts can have one or more accredited Senior
          High School specialization subjects of the media and visual arts strand. Compared to
          the other strands from CIIT Senior High School that can only have one or two majors
          that can have a credit from the specialization subjects. Although, the media and visual
          arts strand can have many majors that can have subject accreditation from the
          specialization subjects from Senior High School. The credited subjects are only limited
          compared to the more specialized strands such as the animation and programming
          strands. It is because of the generalized subjects about multimedia in the media and
          visual arts strand. The animation strand is different from the rest of the strands in terms
          of accreditation. There are two majors in the Bachelor of Multimedia arts that can have
          accreditation for the subjects of the animation strand, which are the Major in Animation
          and the Major in Graphic design. Unlike the media and visual arts strand, the animation
          strand has a lot of subject accreditation in the Bachelor of Multimedia arts Major in
          Animation because of the animation related subjects in Senior High School. The
          programming strand is the most different among all of the Senior High School strands in
          terms of subject accreditation in College. The programming strand is the only strand in
          CIIT Senior High School with full subject accreditation across all of its specialization
          subjects in two bachelor degrees in College which are the Bachelor of Science in
          Computer Science with Specialization in Web and Mobile Application Development, and
          Bachelor of Science in Entertainment and Multimedia Computing with specialization in
          Gamified System Development. There are also similarities between the CIIT Senior
          High School strands when it comes to the College course subject crediting. Both media
          and visual arts and animation strands specialization subjects are creditable in the
          Bachelor of Multimedia Arts, and both strands specialization subjects can be credited in
          two majors. Both animation and programming strands have the most subject
          accreditation in one bachelor program in CIIT College.</p>
        <p class="indent">When it comes to Senior High School, there's going to be a job internship or work
          immersion that will be held. Possible work immersion experience differs from strand to
          strand. The media and visual arts strand may receive a job internship or work
          immersion that will deal with graphic designing, drawing, editorial, publishing, marketing,
          photography, and film and video production. The animation strand can receive a job
          internship or work immersion that will deal with 3D modeling, 3D/2D animation,
          Illustration, and designing. The programming strand, on the other hand, may receive a
          job internship or work immersion that will deal with programming and web development
          compared to the other strands that only deal with arts. The Senior High School strands
          differ from each other when it comes to the job internship or work immersion experience
          and opportunities, but there are also similarities between them. All of the strands can
          have a job internship or work immersion experience with some kind of designing
          involved. All of the strands have 160 hours of working time. The media and visual arts
          and animation strand can experience job internships or work immersion jobs related to
          art. The animation and programming strand may experience more of a collaborative
          environment, because of the collaborative nature of animation and programming
          companies. Outsourcing companies are predominant in the animation and programming
          strands when it comes to job internships or work immersion. The media and visual arts
          and programming strands may have more options when it comes to job internships or
          work immersion jobs, because of the established industry of multimedia and
          programming.
          </p>
          <p class="indent">The CIIT Senior High School Strands cater to different kinds of people and, yet
            they still have a lot of similarities between them in terms of their subjects (Core, Applied,
            and Specialization), College Course Crediting, and Job Internships (Possible Work
            Immersion Experience). The CIIT Senior High School specialization subjects are very
            different from each other, excluding the core and applied subjects because it is a part of
            DepEd's core curriculum which is taken up by all of the tracks and strands. The
            specialization subjects are very specialized to the strand itself with its topics. However,
            there are still similarities between the specialization subjects of the strands, like
            specialization subjects taken up by two strands, similar kinds of subjects, and others.
            The College courses crediting for the strands are very different from each other. A major
            difference is the number of subjects that can be accredited in a bachelor's degree or
            major. There are also similarities when it comes to College course crediting, like
            accreditation. The job internship or possible work immersion experience can differ from
            strands. Every strand is different from each other when it comes to the job internship or
            possible work immersion experience, because jobs vary from strand to strand. The jobs
            are highly specialized for the strands. There are also similarities between the job
            internship or possible work immersion experiences like similar jobs, more collaborative
            jobs, and more. With its differences and similarities when it comes to the subjects (Core,
            Applied, and Specialization), College Course Crediting, and Job Internships (Possible
            Work Immersion Experience). CIIT is still a very specialized school for arts and
            technology. It prepares its students for the 21st-century industry standards.</p>
