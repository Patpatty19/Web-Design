        <p class="indent">Online students are students that are attending online classes due to the 
          pandemic that has been present for more than a year now. Every student in these 
          online classes are suffering due to the overload of works and tasks. Some 
          students would say they have 7-8 tasks per day. This could result students to burn 
          out and get stressed. Social media showed the type of students attending their 
          online classes in this year. Each individual is different from other individuals, 
          which means they have different personalities and traits. These individuals are 
          students. Different kinds of students attending online classes showed their 
          outmost personality when it comes to their classes. Here are some kinds of 
          students attending online classes.</p>
        <p class="indent">The first one is the asleep/ghost type of student. In a recent study, 53.5% of 
          students are sleeping during classes. Almost all of the classes in online classes 
          right now has this kind of student. These are the students that do not talk and 
          respond to teachers when they are being asked or called out. They will attend 
          their online classes but once you call their name, they won’t respond or chat. 
          They could be asleep or just ghosting the teacher. Almost all of the classes start at 
          8 in the morning. Students wake up the minute their classes start resulting to 
          some students sleeping over their classes. Some would prefer sleeping through 
          the entire synchronous class and just look at the recorded lecture afterwards. 
          Lack of their sleep are sometimes caused by too much playing of video games at 
          night.</p>
        <p class="indent">Second type of student in online classes is the gamer student. If the sleepy 
          students were sleeping caused by too much playing video games at night, these 
          students prefer to play while attending online classes. According to a certain 
          study, 30.1% of students prefer to play mobile and computer games while having 
          their synchronous session. Some classes do not require turning on their cameras, 
          which means gamers can play games without getting caught by their teachers. 
          This results that a student can literally just mute their zoom meeting or google meet and just play. They can also be called a ghost type of student but gamers 
          reply and interact with their lecturer to avoid getting caught by them. Sometimes 
          they would answer the questions the lecturer gave at the same time they are 
          playing. Some would use social media to invite some of their friends to play with 
          them while their friends are also attending online classes.</p>
        <p class="indent">Third type of student is the social media student. In a recent study, 13.8% 
          of students are using social media. These students are the ones that are very 
          active in social media but not that active in online classes. They respond to the 
          lecturers and they are more active than the gamer ones. They could also be called 
          as the meme sharer ones. All they do in social media is to share memes while 
          having their synchronous session. You could see them sharing every post they see 
          in Facebook and Twitter. Youtube is also included when it comes to social media 
          students. Instead of watching the lecture of their classes, they would rather watch 
          videos in youtube. Tiktok is also a big part of the social media platform when it 
          comes to students. But some students use social media for their academic 
          purposes especially when it comes to their research and surveys. </p>
        <p class="indent">The fourth type of student is the serious and active student. In a recent 
          study, 26.6% of students are active in their classes. These are the students that 
          are very active in synchronous classes. These are the students that always 
          answers the question of the lecturer. They also open their mics and cameras. 
          Nothing can distract them from their classes. Not games, social media, or their 
          sleep schedule. They balance out the tasks and do it every single day, they play 
          games but not as much as it could destroy their sleeping schedule. Their sleep 
          schedule is followed so that they can attend their classes ready for the next 
          morning. Being a leader in a group work is mostly the most active one in class. 
          Students with honors are considered the most active ones in class. Hardware 
          equipment and wifi connection is not a problem to them.</p>
        <p class="indent">The fifth and last type of student is the internet connection problem 
          student. In a recent study, 61% of students are having internet problems during 
          internet classes. Almost all of the student attending online classes experience 
          problem in their internet connection. Internet connection before the pandemic in 
          the Philippines is slow and below average. Now that online classes are 
          implemented, their last resort is their internet connection. Even the lecturers 
          sometimes have internet problems. I could argue that this is the biggest obstacle and challenge here in online classes. Without internet connection, no tasks can be 
          submitted and worked on, attending a synchronous session is far from being 
          possible, and learning is not an option.</p>
        <p class="indent">There are many more types of students during online classes but these are 
          the most famous ones. Every student is different from each other, some have fast 
          paced type of learning method but some have slow paced type of learning 
          method. Out of all 5 types of students, the internet connection problem type of 
          student can be every student. Most of us are not gifted and cannot afford 
          internet connection. Some would pay up to thousands of pesos every week just to 
          keep up with their classes. Lecturers should also place themselves at the position 
          of their students. If students have a problem with their internet connection, 
          lecturers could excuse them because it is a valid reason. Helping each other in 
          these hard times is a must. Work will be easier if everyone is helping with each 
          other. Being ignorant is one of the traits we should avoid during our online 
          classes. Attending online classes is not a joke and it should be taken more 
          seriously.</p>
