            April 25, 2021
        </address>
        <p class="indent">When I was in Junior Highschool I often wondered what Track and Strand I wanted to pursue 
          because I was unsure on what I wanted to really be back then whether it was being a doctor, 
          programmer, or etc. In the end, I chose the Technical-Vocational-Livelihood track and then chose 
          the ICT strand to learn programming. There are three tracks to choose from when you first enter 
          Senior High School, the three tracks are the Academic, Technical-Vocational-Livelihood, and 
          Sports and arts. In the Academic Track there are three strands Accountancy Business Management 
          (ABM), General Academic Strand (GAS), Humanities and Social Sciences (HUMSS), and Science 
          Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). In the TVL Track there are four strands 
          Information and Communications Technology (ICT), Home Economics, Agri-Fishery Arts, and 
          Industrial Arts. In the sports track, there are not really any specific strands but if you are into sports 
          like playing, or coaching, then this is the right track for you to take. In CIIT, there are currently 2 
          tracks available to students, those tracks are Arts and Design Track - Media and Visual Arts Strand, 
          and Tech Voc Track – ICT Strand. The basis for the comparison is what job/career paths these 
          tracks give to students and their specializations. I personally believe that students need the chance 
          to explore different tracks so that they can find what they really want to pursue.
          </p>
        <p class="indent">First, let us compare Computer Programming and Animation which are both from the TVL track 
          and ICT strand. The differences of these two are, in Computer Programming they are more focused 
          on software development, programming/coding, game development, and etc. Computer 
          Programming specializes in learning different kinds of programming languages and develop 
          working programs. Animation on the other hand focuses more on Traditional Animation, Digital 
          Animation, 2D Animation, 3D Modeling, and etc. Animation specializes in drawing and 
          developing models in 2D or 3D for animating scenes. The similarities of these two strands are that 
          they both need computers to do work on and that certain skill and knowledge is needed to actually 
          use the tools needed for starting Programming and Animation. These two can also work together 
          to create stunning 3D model animations for video games, films, and more.</p>
        <p class="indent">Second, let us compare Animation to Media and Visual Arts. The differences of these two are, in 
          Animation, as I’ve mentioned before, it is more focused on drawing and developing models, 
          however, in Media and Visual Arts, it is more focused in the media and creative industry, more on 
          illustrations, graphic design, and digital art, and it includes career options like Videographer, 
          Photographer, Production Designer, Graphic Designer, Illustrator, and Digital Artist. The 
          similarity of these two is that they both participate in drawing to produce visual outputs. These 
          two can work together to create animated art for professional use like vector art.</p>
        <p class="indent">Last of all, I would like to compare Media and Visual Arts to Computer Programming. I have 
          already mentioned before the differences of each of these strands, as for their similarities, they can 
          collaborate together to create professional looking websites with stunning visual art, friendly user 
          interfaces, and website layouts.</p>
        <p class="indent">In conclusion, I still believe that students need the opportunity to truly explore the Tracks and 
          Strands that are available for their school. All of the strands that are offered in CIIT have the 
          capability to cooperate which each other, for example, if Animation and Computer Programming 
          collaborated with each other, the skills that they have learned will be used to create 3D model 
          animations, visual effects, and etc. I advise future incoming CIITeens to research on what they 
          truly want to do because CIIT gives their all to make way for the dreams of students, especially if 
          the students really pursue what they like to do.</p>
