        <p class="indent">I’m sure we’ve always wondered on how the stars and space looked like when we were a child.
          Now that we’ve all gotten older, we get more curious because of the complexity of what’s out 
          there. However, we must look back on how the ancient people looked at our universe before we 
          came to our current theories about space. One of these theories is the Pythagorean Model, which 
          is proposed by Philolaus, a student of Pythagoras. You may also know Pythagoras from the 
          Pythagorean Theorem. Pythagoras’ theory about the model of the universe helped shape on what 
          our current theories have become because of his teachings that inspired his students.</p>
        <p class="indent">Pythagoras was known to be the first one that assumed the Earth is round, and that the heavenly 
          bodies move around in circles. In the model that is proposed by him, the Earth is at rest at the 
          center of the universe while everything rotates around it. He believed that the other planets and 
          stars revolved around the center which in his model is the Earth. Pythagoras also said that the 
          motions of the planets were mathematically related to musical sounds and numbers, and he called 
          these “The Music of the Spheres”. After the declaration of his theories, his students or apprentices 
          followed him in his footsteps in theorizing. One of his students is called Anaxagoras, he was 
          credited with having figured out the relative positions of the sun, the moon, and Earth during solar 
          and lunar eclipses. Another student of Pythagoras is Philolaus, he is the one that proposed that the 
          Earth and the other planets did not revolve around the sun but rather a “central fire”.</p>
        <p class="indent">Although there are many other theories about the universe, I believe that because of Pythagoras
          and his philosophies and teachings, he has inspired many others to go in his footsteps to theorize 
          on the universe. And because of that, our theories about are world or solar system today has been 
          figured out. In conclusion, the theories that has been proposed by Pythagoras and then adopted by 
          his students like Anaxagoras and Philolaus, has helped shaped our theories today.</p>
