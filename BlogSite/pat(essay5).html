        <p class="indent">Saving one’s life makes you awesome and at the same time a savior. Saving one’s life is 
          not easy and will never be easy. A chance of ending one’s life can be done if you do It in a wrong 
          order or step. CPR or Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation is a technique used by many people when 
          it comes to emergencies, life ending situation. This technique can be learned by any normal 
          person. Learning the technique will be useful when you are in a severe situation wherein 
          someone is dying and his/her life is in danger. You can save someone if they suddenly had a heart 
          attack or drowning resulting their heartbeat to stop (Barell, A. 2020). Steps on doing CPR is hard 
          because you are in charge of the life of the someone who is dying and one wrong move could 
          end the life of the one you are trying to save. Here are the steps on how to do CPR in a correct 
          and safe way to prevent any major casualties to the victim.</p>
        <p class="indent">The first step in performing CPR is to prepare yourself first. Put your mindset wherein you 
          are trying to save somebody and saving him/her is the biggest priority at that moment. Prepare 
          yourself for the worst. Keep calm and do not let anxiety and nervousness eat you up. Check the 
          scene and the person. If he/she is not responding, call 911 or ask someone to call 911. Try to find 
          a professional in the scene and seek for their help. Try to hold out as much as the victim can to 
          wait for the professionals to arrive in the scene.</p>
        <p class="indent">Next, place the person carefully on their back in a safe spot and kneel beside their chest. 
          Be extremely cautious on the person that you are trying to save. Remember, he/she is not 
          conscious at the moment. Tilt their head back slightly by lifting their chin. Check inside their 
          mouth if he or she is choking. Remove any object or food that could be blocking the airway. Be 
          extremely careful when you are trying to get the object because it may result to fully be pushed 
          farther.</p>
        <p class="indent">The next step is to check the breathing of the victim. Place your ear next to the person’s 
          mouth and listen for 10 seconds. If he/she is not breathing or not gasping, begin performing CPR. 
          If the victim is still breathing do not perform CPR. Only monitor their breathing and perform CPR 
          if the victim stopped breathing. Do not perform straight CPR because instead of saving the victim, 
          chances of being more damaged can happen.</p>
        <p class="indent">The fourth step is to perform chest compressions. There are different kinds of positions 
          of hand and fingers depending on the victim. This differs when it comes to adults, children, and 
          infants. Doing the adult CPR requires both hands on top of the other. With the heel of the hands 
          and straight elbows, push hard and fast in the center of the chest, slightly below the nipples. 
          Perform 30 chest compressions at a rate of 100 per minute. Be extremely careful when it comes 
          to children especially infants.</p>
        <p class="indent">The next step is the most important step and could save someone’s life. At this stage, 
          rescue breaths are performed. After removing an object that could be blocking the airway, you 
          have the go signal to do rescue breaths. Pinch their nose shut, place your mouth fully over theirs 
          and blow to make their chest rise. If their chest does not rise with the first breath, retilt their 
          head. If it still doesn’t rise, the person might be choking. Check if something is still blocking the 
          airway and immediately remove it carefully. One wrong move and it could be pushed farther 
          away.</p>
        <p class="indent">The last step is to repeat all the steps you performed. Do all these steps in order until the 
          person becomes conscious. Do this technique when you are still waiting for the professionals to
          arrive in the scene. Hold out as much as you can until ambulance arrives. If an AED or Automated 
          External Defibrillator arrives, carry on performing CPR until the machine is set up and ready to 
          use.</p>
        <p class="indent">Doing CPR is not a joke and extremely hard to do. With the pressure that comes from 
          literally saving one’s life is so hard to bear. CPR usually performs when someone is not breathing. 
          You only have 8 minutes to spare if you are not breathing. More than 8 minutes, death arrives. 
          Be sure to check if the victim is not responding to any calls before doing CPR. CPR should be 
          taught to everyone because anything could happen in anytime. Practicing chest compressions 
          and rescue breaths can help someone to survive. Always remember, only use CPR when the 
          victim has stopped breathing. Hold out as much as you can until help arrives. If the victim is 
          conscious, calm the victim down and support his/her body and help them to move in to a safer 
          place and position. Talk to the victim but do not bombard them with words that could potentially 
          increase stress. Saving the life of a certain someone is should always be taken seriously. Learning 
          this technique won’t hurt anybody and could potentially save someone at any given time. Being 
          a savior of one’s life doesn’t sound bad. You could also save someone from a traumatic feeling 
          and experience that will last until their day of death. </p>
