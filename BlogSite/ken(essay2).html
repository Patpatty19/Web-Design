            April 4, 2021

        <p class="indent">Patrick Miguel M. Babala, most commonly known as Pat, is a person that can befriend
          anyone he wants to. He is a very chill person, that is what makes him a very approachable
          person. He has been my friend ever since I started studying at CIIT SHS. I can see him making
          friends with other people while the school year hasn't even started yet. The act of befriending
          people that you have never met before. Even when the school year hasn't started, and while we
          are on a work-at-home set up because of the pandemic, is impressive. As soon as the school
          year started, Patrick's friends in CIIT grew, and now I am a part of the group of friends that
          Patrick had made. Those actions get to show that people like him can connect people like me to
          other people.</p>
        <p class="indent">Patrick is a friendly person. He had made friends with many types of people in CIIT and
          presumably a lot more before. He had befriended people from other sections and strands, and
          even seniors in CIIT on and before the school year had started. Patrick is an extroverted guy
          which explains how he can make friends with different types of people with ease. Patrick
          connects people by just being himself. An example of this is how I ended up in a friendship with
          his friends that he made before the school year has started. Little by little, his friends also
          became my friends.
          </p>
        <p class="indent">In terms of talking and chatting, Patrick is a very approachable person. He is always
          there when you need someone to talk to. When it comes to casual conversations, he is always
          fun to chat or talk to because he always has ways to make things very interesting and fun. In
          terms of serious talks with Patrick like, problems and such, he always has ways to lessen the
          tension and calm things down. He is a joyful person, and that is what makes him a lovely person
          to talk to. It is not always a problem to approach Patrick and talk about something with him.
          </p>
        <p class="indent">Patrick is wonderfully supportive of his friends. He always supports his friends in their
          hobbies and achievements. I always see him showing his support whatever he can to other
          people especially, those who have an artistic background who make art. It is nice to know that
          you have a friend like him because you know that there will always be someone there to support
          you in your hobbies and achievements. He is always there for his friends. If it is for the support
          or companionship you need, you can count on him to be there for you.</p>
        <p class="indent">Patrick is a very wonderful person. But he is not the best person in the world, he is not
          the most extraordinary person but; that doesn't mean that he is not a very special person. He is
          the type of person that can befriend anyone that he wants to because of his very friendly
          attributes. But he is not the only one with those attributes. Patrick is very special because he is
          my friend, our friend that is what makes him very special. There will be a person out there or
          even multiple people just like him. It is just a matter of you finding your Patrick Miguel Babala.
