        <p class="indent">As we grow older and become more mature, we do not suffer from any childlike 
            problems. Some of them can be still a problem but only a limited amount of it. One of the most 
            important decision in our lives is what career should we pursue? As a student, tracks are the 
            most important paths toward careers. Studying a certain track can help us students narrow 
            down our choices of careers. If you have passion towards photography and multimedia, Media 
            and Visual Arts track will do the thing for you. If 3d modeling and Storyboard are the works you 
            want to do, Animation track will be best for you. If coding and software developing are your 
            passion, then the Programming track is the one that is best for you. Each tracks are very 
            different yet similar with each other. They can help you pursue a creative or artistic careers.</p>
        <p class="indent">Media and Visual Arts track focuses on photography and multimedia art. These two 
            things are different but connected with each other. Photography needs the help of multimedia, 
            while multimedia needs the help of photography at some point. Specialization subjects of this 
            track are digital photography, fundamentals of film and video production, writing for new 
            media, and multimedia publishing. Once you have learned these particular subjects, some 
            careers connected to this track are waiting. Career options are being a videographer, 
            photographer, production designer, graphic designer illustrator, and a digital artist. Some of 
            these careers are very in demand right now. Which means companies are searching for people 
            that exceeds in this track. Logos, designs, billboards, and other designing work are an example 
            of what job you could have if you pursue this track.</p>
        <p class="indent">Graphic designs are one of the most important skill you need in the art industry.
            Animation track also teaches graphic design. While media and visual arts focuses on 
            photography and multimedia art, animation track focuses on animation of 3d modeling made 
            my animators. Animation is not the only thing they teach in this track, storyboard and layout 
            are also being taught here. 3d modeling are nothing without its storyboard and layout. 2d and 
            3d perspective are what expert animators excel of. If you have the skill and talent to become an 
            expert animator in the future then the careers you can have are: dynamic or animated web 
            designer, storyboard artist, 2d and 3d layout artist, 3d animator, and 3d architectural designer. 
            Companies that works on animation have a high amount of pay. Being an excellent animator 
            takes so much skill which means being one of them is a must have for higher companies. Disney 
            animators are an example of excellent animators.</p>
        <p class="indent">Besides art related careers, a certain track is also being taught in CIIT. This is the 
            Computer Programming track. As a student who had no programming background before in 
            high school, this is the correct school to enroll to if you want to learn on how to code and 
            program a software. Programmers at this day and age are very in demand. Only few have the skill to program and code. Option for a career in programming are: system programmer, system 
            analyst, software application developer/engineer, graphics programmer, game designer, and 
            senior interactive software developer. A programmer takes too much skill because you are 
            dealing with the software of the computer. Some would argue as a programmer you are 
            basically talking to the computer. Being a programmer is very hard and programming or coding 
            is a very hard thing to do. Once you mastered the art of coding, creating a software is basically 
            an easy task.</p>
        <p class="indent">Each of these tracks are very different yet very similar with each other. They can all 
            work in the same company. A video game company has all of this people that exceeds in 
            multimedia, animation, and programming. Multimedia experts deal with character designs, 
            Animation experts deal with the movement and 3d modeling of the environment of the game. 
            They could also do the storyboard and layout. Programming experts combine both the 
            characters and the movements in a particular software that runs the game. Each of these tracks 
            work very well with each other. All of the completed works combined to a single completed 
            work can represent a successful company. It could a video game company, advertising 
            company, movie company and many more. Designing is one of the similar traits each of these 
            tracks have. Each track has different specialization subjects and career options but are still 
            connected with each other in a way. Without the help of the other track, work might pile up 
            and has the chance of not finishing the task.</p>
