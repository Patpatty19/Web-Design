            <b>Christian I. Denzon</b><br>
            April 26, 2021
        </address>
        <p class="indent">In this time of pandemic, we’ve leaned onto technology more, specifically computers. Using a 
          computer is now part of our everyday life since people attend to their jobs there, students use it so 
          that they can study online through the internet, and it is usually the place where most people get 
          their news from because the internet is accessible anytime which means the news is up to date.
          However, some people may face a problem with their computers and that problem is the device 
          being slow. By slow, I mean that the computer is lagging whenever something opens, and that they
          cannot create files because they do not have enough storage. In this essay, I will list down the 
          possible causes of a slow computer and its effects. I strongly recommend to research about 
          computers so that you don’t get scammed, since most of the time, when people experience their 
          computers getting slow, they instantly replace the whole unit which is much more expensive than 
          identifying the problem and if possible, upgrade that component instead of replacing the whole 
          computer.
          </p>
        <p class="indent">The first possible cause is quite common, and that is when the specifications of the computer itself 
          is not really capable of handling the software that you use. The effect of a computer with incapable 
          specifications is that it will lag whenever you try to open any software such as: browsers, Microsoft 
          Word, MS Teams, Zoom, and many other software. Another effect that is in tandem with a bad 
          computer is the computer operating really slow when you do tasks. As an example, in my 
          experience, whenever I try to open software that is demanding for processing power, like a video 
          editor, my computer chugs meaning that it slows down. This chug can be easily felt when you play 
          graphic demanding games too.
          </p>
        <p class="indent">The second possible cause is that you don’t have enough disk drive space or storage for files. The 
          effect of not having enough storage space is the computer slows down when you don’t have enough 
          free space because the computer creates files, delete them, and move files so that means that the 
          computer needs enough free space to do that. Usually, the issue of not having enough space can 
          be simple solved by emptying the recycling bin, and deleting temporary files.
          </p>
        <p class="indent">The third possible cause is that you might have a malware or virus in your computer. Most viruses 
          run in the background of the computer, meaning that you can’t actively see it and it also uses most 
          of the performance of the computer. Because of that, the computer will slow down and run very 
          sluggish. Some viruses can be easily removed from your computer by using antiviruses like 
          Windows Defender and Malwarebytes.</p>
        <p class="indent">There are many other possible causes for a slow computer but the three causes that I have discussed 
          in this essay is part of the most common and reasonable cause out there. Learning the cause of 
          slow computers and its effects is beneficial to us because we can come to a solution when we’re 
          facing such problems. Now that we have the knowledge, we can decide whether to upgrade or 
          replace the unit itself. In conclusion, we should take the time to be knowledgeable and responsible
          on our computer so that we can take care of it.</p>
