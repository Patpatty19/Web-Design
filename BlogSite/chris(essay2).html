            April 3, 2021

        <p class="indent">Children tend to adapt to things that you don’t expect, may it be hobbies like watching television 
          playing games, talking with friends, and etc. When I was a child, I used to play hide and seek with 
          my friends and we also used to talk about famous cartoon shows. Now that I’m older, I realize that 
          me and my friends actually influenced each other’s interests. I believe that the experiences that we 
          go through as a child has a big effect on what our hobbies, likes, dislikes, and interests, are today.
          </p>
        <p class="indent">When Ken was in 1
          st grade in elementary school, he was enrolled in a private school which meant 
          that he was surrounded with all the comfort and security that a child would need and prefer. The 
          comfortable environment made him pursue on his education, leading to him being the neatest
          student and also an honor student. As for his hobby, he only played on a game console called 
          PlayStation Portable. When he went on to move up to 2nd grade, his parents had to move him to a
          different school, but this time it was a public school, making him unfamiliar with his surroundings 
          or environment. The whole year, he couldn’t participate much in school because he felt out of 
          place, as if he didn’t belong there. Time went by and he went on to 3rd grade, this time he made 
          effort to make friends and socialize, this resulted in him meeting his best friend who he is good 
          friends with up to this day. He mentioned that around this time, he got a phone tablet which helped 
          him in finding out about video games, and he started playing them. On 4th grade, he discovered 
          various hobbies like using social media like Facebook to start finding other friends, watching
          cartoons such as Adventure Time, Gravity Falls, and Steven universe, and he also took an interest 
          to drawing around this time, but never really started to draw himself. In 5th grade, Ken had a fight 
          with his best friend, resulting in his friendship with them being halted to a stop. However, he found 
          another friend who was the top in the class and the smartest. They mixed well together because 
          they had the same interests like video games, and music. Finally in 6th grade, his hobbies and 
          interests increased which are watching anime and cartoons, playing video games, and browsing 
          the internet. He also made peace with his best friend and they got together again. This is when his 
          group of friends increased because of the help of internet and social media. He mentioned that all 
          of the things mentioned above and people who he was with were what shaped him on what he is 
          like today.</p>
        <p class="indent">The lesson of his story is that most of the things that we have our opinions like our likes, dislikes, 
          hobbies, and interests are greatly influenced by what we have went through as a child, what we 
          learned as we went through those experiences. This is important to remember because this helps 
          us analyze and find a conclusion on why we like and hate some things, why we watch a specific 
          kind of show genre, and etc. In conclusion, we are influenced by our surroundings, the people that we meet, the movies that we see, the actions that we witness, and most importantly the lessons that 
          we experience throughout our life, this is my reflection.</p>
