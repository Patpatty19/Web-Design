            <b>Christian I. Denzon</b><br>
            April 25, 2021
        </address>
        <p class="indent">In this time of the pandemic, online learning is the only choice that students can do to still attend 
          school, however, students may find online learning difficult, a hassle, challenging, or some might 
          say that it makes them inspired, and engaging. Because of those reasons, students may skip class, 
          sleep during class, or some may attend and participate actively. The Online Students/Learners is 
          an umbrella term that includes a variety of types of students that attend school online. If you’re a 
          student that is attending online school, it is inevitable that you will fall under one of the five student 
          types.</p>
        <p class="indent">The first type that I will be talking about is the type of student that always sleep in class and does 
          not participate, in our flowchart that student is called the “ZZZZZZ Student/Ghost Student”. To 
          describe the Ghost Student is very simple, a Ghost Student is typically a student that does not 
          attend class at all or a student that just sleep in class therefore it also being called the “ZZZZZZ 
          Student”. This idea is supported because of people I know that sleep in class a lot or attend class 
          but don’t participate.
          </p>
        <p class="indent">The second type of student that I will talking about next is the student that is always on Social 
          Media. The Social Media student can be identified if they attend class but is on other tabs or apps 
          and if they use social media while in class and if they don’t participate. That series of conditions 
          leads to a student being identified as a Social Media Student. This is supported by the fact that all 
          students have Social Media and since they aren’t actively monitored like the camera isn’t turned 
          on, they can just access their devices anytime and the teacher would not notice.
          </p>
        <p class="indent">The third type of student is the Gamer Student. The Gamer Student can be identified by the 
          following conditions: The gamer student still attends class, they use other apps while in class, and 
          if they play games while in class. Gamer students tend to still attend in class but once attended, 
          they will minimize the class and focus back on their games, not paying attention to the lecture that 
          is ongoing. This is supported by a very recent viral video that went into trending where the student 
          was playing while in class and he didn’t mute his mic leading to him being heard by his teacher 
          and his fellow classmates. They tried to call for him but after some analyzation, it became obvious 
          that the student had his class muted so he couldn’t hear anything that was being said in the class.</p>
        <p class="indent">The fourth type of student is the Connection Problem Student. This type of student can be easily 
          identified if they often have bad internet connection and if they keep disconnecting in class. In my 
          opinion, these types of students are very common in the Philippines. This is supported by the fact 
          that we don’t have good affordable internet in the Philippines, because of that, people have no 
          choice but to settle with the internet that they have which are usually slow.</p>
        <p class="indent">The fifth and last type of student that I will be talking about is the Active Student. The Active 
          Student is usually the type of student that is always attending class, and the one that always asks 
          the teacher with questions about the lecture. These students usually chat with teachers a lot and 
          they always answer attentively. These are supported by the fact that there is always that one or few 
          students that actively participate in class which makes them stand out from the others.
          </p>
        <p class="indent">As long as you’re a student attending online school, you will be in no doubt be classified into at 
          the least one type of online student out of the five available types. The five types of student are: 
          The Ghost Student, the one who sleeps in class and doesn’t participate, The Social Media Student, 
          the one who is all over social media all day, the Gamer Student, the one who attends but just sets 
          aside the class and continue to play, the Connection Problem Student, the one who has bad internet, 
          and lastly the Active Student, the role model of every class and the one who always participates 
          on what’s going on. In conclusion, I believe that every online student falls into one of the 
          types/category and I also believe that their type can change from time to time.</p>
