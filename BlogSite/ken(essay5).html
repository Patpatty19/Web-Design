            <b>Ken Adrian A. Alupit</b><br>
            April 28, 2021
        </address>
        <p class="indent">Our computers are one of the most essential things in our lives, especially right
          now that there’s a pandemic where we use our computers almost all day, every day. We
          need to protect our computers in any way we can. The best and the most sensible way
          to protect any computer is installing software to shield the computer from any malicious
          software. Anti-virus and anti-malware are the most popular software programs that can
          combat malicious software, but these kinds of software programs usually have heavy
          price tags listed on them. There are anti-virus and anti-malware software programs that
          offer free service and installation. Most of these softwares can be a nuisance because
          of few reasons: poor performance slowing down your computer instead of making it
          faster, inadequate protection for malicious software, and lack of features. In this how-to
          tutorial, we will install the free version of Kaspersky anti-virus software for Windows 10.
          Kaspersky is an anti-virus program that uses the power of the cloud to have a real-time
          database of cyber threats that can be used for identifying malicious software in users'
          devices. This database is also frequently updated to ensure the most security to all
          devices connected to it. Kaspersky also has a system wherein it collects new kinds of
          cyber threats such as viruses, malware, ransomware, and more from users' devices to
          process and add to their database so that users can have the latest and greatest
          protection on their systems. Other than those special features that Kaspersky offers, it
          also has features that other antivirus programs have like; system scans, file scans, file
          exclusions, real-time protection, browser protection, and more. Kaspersky is one of the
          best free antivirus software that you can download on Windows 10.
          </p>
        <p class="indent">The first step in installing Kaspersky is to check if your computer meets the
          system requirements of the Kaspersky anti-virus program. The requirements for the
          Kaspersky anti-virus program are; Internet connection for the product activation and
          updates (you could always use the program with no internet connection after the initial
          installation of the program, although using it this way will handicap the capabilities of the
          program, because it is not connected through the cloud), a memory/RAM capacity of 1
          GB for 32-bit systems or 2 GB for 64-bit systems (you can know if your computer is 32
          or 64 bit in the settings at the system section and about page/tab), free disk space of
          1.5GB (you can check your free storage space in file explorer), and a 1GHz or higher
          processor (you can check your processors GHz in the task manager at the performance
          page/tab). If all checks out, you may proceed to the next step, and if not, your computer
          can be now classified as a potato.
          </p>
        <p class="indent">For the second step, you will have to check if any incompatible programs are
          installed on your computer, like anti-virus and or anti-malware programs, and then
          uninstall any incompatible programs. This also prevents you from being that person that
          has a million antivirus and or anti-malware programs, and then asks other people why
          their computer slows down when all of their anti-virus and or anti-malware programs
          scan the computer all at once. Using incompatible programs alongside Kaspersky can
          result in frequent errors, and worse case scenarios, total system errors. All of the lists of
          incompatible programs can be accessed <a href="https://support.kaspersky.com/15515#block1">here</a>. If there is incompatible software present
          on your computer, you should delete it before proceeding to the next steps. You can
          delete programs by searching for them in Windows, and there will be a button for
          uninstalling the program at its side. If there are no buttons present, you can search for
          the add or remove programs in Windows settings. That is where you can search for the
          program you will be uninstalling and delete it. Once you checked and uninstalled all of
          the incompatible programs, you can proceed to the next step.
          </p>
        <p class="indent">Downloading the setup file will be the third step in installing the Kaspersky
          anti-virus program. Finding the free version of the anti-virus from Kaspersky can be
          tricky, but you can find the downloadable setup file <a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/free-antivirus">here</a>. After the download process,
          you can click the download prompt that you can see at the bottom of your browser or in
          the downloads folder of file explorer, this will open the installation process.
          </p>
          <p class="indent">When the installation wizard has started, it will start to find the newest version of
            the program if the downloaded setup file is not up to date. You may skip this process
            altogether if you know that you downloaded the right file, and you didn't time-traveled
            back to download a later version of the file. After it checks for newer versions, or if you
            skip the scanning process, it will display a prompt greeting you and a button for
            continuing the installation which you will be clicking (Note: By clicking the continue
            button you will be agreeing with their end-user license agreement).</p>
          <p class="indent">After clicking the Continue button, you will be prompted that everything is ready
            to be installed, and two pre-checked checkboxes can also be seen below it. The first
            checkbox is for the participation of Kaspersky's Security Network (KSN). If left enabled,
            Kaspersky can gather data about your system/computer. You may uncheck this if you
            are not comfortable with sharing your information, however, this will not affect the
            performance of the anti-virus program. This option can be turned on or off after the
            installation. The second checkbox is for installing additional software from Kaspersky. It
            is their Password manager. You may opt-out of this if you don't have any use for it. After
            deciding if opting in or out from the checkboxes, you can click the install button to
            proceed. If some incompatible programs are found there will be a prompt that will show
            a list of all of the programs. You can click remove selected to make Kaspersky uninstall
            all of the incompatible programs, or you may also do this process manually, like with
            step two. After this, the Kaspersky anti-virus program will now be installed on your
            Windows computer. This process may take a while, so you can do other things while it
            is still installing.
            </p>
            <p class="indent">Once the installation is done there will be another prompt that has four
              checkboxes that are all pre-checked. These are the recommended settings for the
              Kaspersky anti-virus program. The first three checkboxes are recommended to be
              selected for optimal and best security possible in your system. The last checkbox is for
              a tour of the program for a better understanding of how it works. This is a must if you're
              a new user or a non-tech savvy person. Otherwise, you can opt-out of it. After deciding,
              you can now click the apply button, and this will take you to the final page of the
              installation process.</p>
            <p class="indent">There will now be a prompt telling you that the application has been installed on
              your Windows 10 computer. You may click the done button to start using your
              Kaspersky anti-virus program. Once clicked, you will be greeted with a login screen
              asking for your email that is linked to your Kaspersky account, but if you don't have a
              Kaspersky account yet, you can make it in the application window itself or at the
              Kaspersky website. If done at the application itself, you can input your email address at
              the prompt, and the sign-up process will continue. Make sure to input the necessary
              information that is being asked. If your preference is to make it on the Kaspersky
              website, you can go <a href="https://my.kaspersky.com/en">here</a> and fill up the necessary information. After creating an
              account, you can log in to your Kaspersky account in the Kaspersky anti-virus program
              and start using it right away. If the account is new, you will receive a free month of
              membership to the premium personal or family protection, you may decline this offer if
              you wanted to, but who would say no to free stuff?
              </p>
              <p class="indent">After installing the Kaspersky anti-virus program, there are some pre-installation
                steps to do to ensure utmost security in your system. When you are at the main page of
                the Kaspersky anti-virus program, you may see a prompt that says that your protection
                is live, and commonly when it is a new installation, there are recommendations that
                Kaspersky advises you to do for the most security for your system. You may click the
                details button to enable the advised recommendations by Kaspersky. When it is a fresh
                install, one of these recommendations is to update the database. You can update the
                database on the recommendations page/ notification center by clicking the update
                button, you may also update the database on the home screen with the most obvious
                button labeled database update. After these steps, you are done! Your system is now
                well protected by the Kaspersky anti-virus program.
                </p>
                <p class="indent">Kaspersky is one of the best free antivirus software that you can download and
                  install on your Windows 10 computer, and Kaspersky anti-virus has also been
                  nominated as the number one best free antivirus software by PCMag and tom's guide
                  for 2021. The free version of the Kaspersky anti-virus program has also been tested
                  with many viruses, malware, and ransomware by reviewers on Youtube, with none of
                  the malicious software passing through Kaspersky's system. So you know that
                  Kaspersky is a very safe and secure way to protect your computer while being free to
                  use. Although having very strong protection in your computer is good, prevention is
                  always the key to a safer and more secure computer. Downloading and visiting from
                  trusted websites, Not clicking any suspicious ads, links, and emails are some of the
                  examples of prevention that everybody can and should do to protect their computers.
                  Having a program that protects your computer like Kaspersky is just an extra way to
                  protect your computer. So stay safe and happy computing!
