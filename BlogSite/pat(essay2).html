        <p class="indent">At this day and age, people are giving up so easily. Trying isn’t even a word for them. 
            Giving up easily is very normal at this era. In this world full of passionless and empty people, 
            there is a man named Christian Denzon. A man that faces challenges without any fear. A man 
            that keeps on striving to survive every single day. A man that does not give up. A man who will 
            face more hardships in the future. Only few people knew how courageous and amiable this 
            man is. He is Christian Denzon, a man with a strong will.</p>
        <p class="indent">Christian is a simple yet outstanding man. He loves technology. Computers are one of 
            his favorite things in life. Without his computer, his life is not complete. Some would say he is a 
            computer nerd because he knows a lot about computers. He knows the hardware part of the 
            computer and even the software part. He can be pretty lazy sometimes but he still passes in 
            school. His grades are average in school and said that he is a “shut-in”. He loves playing 
            computer games and makes computer games his stress reliever. He only socializes with his 
            friends online and not with strangers. He also defined himself as a shy person. When it comes 
            to interaction with strangers, his shyness shows. He has few friends but they treasure them all. 
            Recently, a person became one of his very important people in his life. She is now his partner.</p>
        <p class="indent">He is a normal kid in school when it comes to socializing. He usually socializes with boys. 
            He met a girl in his life and did not expect that she would be his partner in the future. Before 
            they become a couple, the girl was fresh from a breakup. He did his best to be there for her and 
            did not leave her alone. Soon the girl realized his doings and they made their relationship clear. 
            They are now partners! He helped the girl before to escape from a very toxic relationship. He 
            did this like a “knight in shining armor” for her. Christian made up his mind before they become 
            a couple. He wants to protect this girl from toxic men. He wants this girl to feel happiness. He 
            wants to stay by her side all the time.</p>
        <p class="indent">The pandemic started but it was no barrier for him. The only thing that is scaring 
            Christian is academics in online classes. Fear of not learning anything is a part of it. It is very 
            understandable because going to college is just 2 years from now. Learning in online classes is a 
            very hard part for Christian. It is the same with other students who are having a hard time in 
            online classes. Requirements are piling up, technical issues are occurring, and internet 
            connection is not stable. Even though problems are occurring to him, his perseverance and 
            strong will shows. He tries his best to learn from online classes, he tries his best to be patient, and he tries his best to have a strong heart. The pandemic is a long way from being over. 
            Patience and perseverance are needed. Many students gave up in online classes but he is one 
            of the students who are still striving to have a good future. He has goals and plans in the future 
            that is why he thinks of this online classes as just a challenge to have a bright future.</p>
        <p class="indent">Only few people in this world are like Christian. A good and brave man that will do 
            anything for the better things in his life. At such a young age, he shows that he can survive in 
            this world with his strong will. Christian will still grow as a person and will face more challenges. 
            Giving up is not an answer to speed up life. As we grow older, more and more challenges will 
            appear. “Striving for success without hard work is life trying to harvest where you haven’t 
            planted”. – David Bly</p>
