            <b>Ken Adrian A. Alupit</b><br>
            April 16, 2021
        </address>
        <p class="indent">We live in a pandemic time right now. Almost all of the activities we do before are
          now done on the internet, and this includes education. The sudden shift in the delivery
          of knowledge reveals new types of students in the online environment. Students are still
          students even if the place and mode of delivery have changed, but there will surely be
          changes. Being in an online environment, it is easier for students to be themselves
          behind the camera. Compared to the face-to-face approach of the later years, the
          behavior between students varies from one to the other. Students now show behaviors
          that they cannot do when in a face-to-face environment.
          </p>
        <p class="indent">The most common type of student that can be seen during online classes is the
          ghost students. The <b>ghost students</b> are students who attend online classes but don't
          participate or cooperate with teachers and their classmates. They sometimes even do
          not attend classes at all. The punctuality between ghost students varies from one to the
          other. Some do all their work and pass them on time, while others do not. Some of the
          ghost students interact with their classmates, but when it comes to online classes with
          the teachers, the ghost student will disappear. There are also ghost students where they
          interact with teachers while in online class, but do not interact with their classmates after
          online classes like in group works or group projects. The ghost students' reasons as to
          why they do what they do vary, but one of the significant reasons is sleeping, and some
          of the other reasons are partly connected to the other types of students.
          </p>
        <p class="indent">Some students browse social media apps and sites while in an online class.
          These are the <b>social media students</b>. Sharing posts, memes, and talking to other
          people are some of the examples that social media students do while in an online class.
          Most of the social media students don't listen to the teachers, who are conducting the
          online class, and they don't participate as well. Some can manage to be attentive and
          participate in the online class while they do their stuff, but this is rare. You can usually
          see social media students share posts or memes on social media while the online class
          is still ongoing. Most of the social media students cooperate and interact with their
          classmates when the class is over. Social media students' reason for not being attentive
          in an online class and resorting to browsing social media could be because they find
          themselves bored and uninterested in the class. This can be also a way for them to
          cope with stress. This type of student could also fall into the ghost students if they are
          unresponsive or uncooperative with their classmates and teachers.
          </p>
        <p class="indent">One of the most common types of students that can be seen in online classes is
          gamer students. <b>Gamer students</b> usually play online games or games in general during
          online classes. Most of these students don't listen or participate in the online class
          because they are too preoccupied with playing. You can usually see gamer students'
          status in Discord if they are playing something. They don't stop, even if there is an
          upcoming online class, but they will join online classes when it starts for the sake of
          attendance and nothing else. Because of this, they sometimes forget to leave the online
          class. Gamer students also cannot be bothered with group activities or group projects,
          especially with meetings. This student is another type of student that is partly related to
          the ghost students.
          </p>
          <p class="indent">Another one of the most common types of students in the online class
            environment is the <b>connection problem students</b>. These students are the ones that
            have the most problems when it comes to the internet. Slow connection speed, internet
            interruptions, laggy and delayed audio, video signals, and more are the common
            problems when it comes to the students' internet. This results in the student being late
            for an online class or being completely absent, incapable of participating in class,
            inability to speak, and many more. Because of the sudden switch to an online
            environment for education. A lot of students who don't have a good and stable internet
            connection are now struggling. The connection problem students is another type of
            student that is partly related to the ghost students.</p>
            <p class="indent">These are the students who participate and cooperate in online classes and even
              before when it was a face-to-face environment. They are called <b>active students</b>.
              Usually, they belong to the group of students who excel in class. In an online class
              environment, the active students are the ones who generally talk and socialize with the
              teachers, and they are the ones who frequently recite in class. They are the ones who
              fill in the gap for the students, who don't participate in online classes like the ones
              mentioned before. Some of the active students in online classes are not active before
              when it was a face-to-face environment. They had only been more active when classes
              switched to an online environment because some students are more comfortable
              working at home and by themselves. Active students actively participate in school
              activities and group projects and they also pass all of their requirements in time.
              </p>
              <p class="indent">The five types of students seen in an online class are <b>ghost students</b>, <b>social
                media students</b>, <b>gamer students</b>, <b>internet problem students</b>, and <b>active students</b>.
                Because of the shift to online education, students now show behaviors that they cannot
                reveal when classes were still in a face-to-face environment. It is easier for students to
                do whatever they want while in an online class because there is no supervision from the
                teachers. Although students can do everything they want, there are still problems that
                face them hindering their education. Mental health problems and internet problems are
                two of the most common ones.</p>
                <p class="indent">Because of the sudden changes in the delivery of education due to the
                  pandemic, we can also see changes in the students. Online education is not the best for
                  the students and teachers right now, but these kinds of things are what builds a better
                  future. Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes today and build a better future for
                  education</p>
