        <p class="indent">Eudoxus’s planetary model is an outdated and incorrect model of the solar
          system/universe, but it is an example of how we can turn mistakes into great discoveries.
          Eudoxus of Cnidus was an ancient Greek astronomer, mathematician, and scholar. He is also a
          student of Archytas and Plato who are both ancient Greek philosophers. Eudoxus’s model is a
          geocentric planetary model that depicts Earth as the center of the universe/solar system where
          all of the heavenly bodies (i.e planets, solar systems, and stars) revolve around Earth. It is
          unlike the heliocentric planetary model that is used today, where the planets revolve around the
          sun. Eudoxus’s planetary model is undeniably incorrect. A reason for it to be incorrect is the use
          of a geocentric planetary model instead of a heliocentric model that is more accurate.</p>
        <p class="indent">There are also other reasons why it is considered incorrect. Eudoxus’s planetary model
          helped shape our understanding of the solar system and planetary revolution by introducing
          ideas and concepts on how the universe/solar system could have worked. Eudoxus is a
          mathematician and an astronomer, which explains how he came up with his idea of a geocentric
          solar system where he calculated the time in which the heavenly bodies revolve around Earth.
          His model consists of 27 concentric spheres around Earth where each planet resides and
          revolves opposite to each other creating a figure 8 motion. Eudoxus’s model depicts Earth as
          the center of the solar system with the heavenly bodies arranged with the Moon at the closest
          with three spheres, Mercury at the second with four spheres, Venus at the third with four
          spheres, the Sun at the fourth with three spheres, Mars at the fifth with four spheres, Jupiter at
          the sixth with four spheres, and Saturn in the seventh with four spheres. The model also has
          fixed stars that reside on the last sphere.</p>
        <p class="indent">The Eudoxus model answers the question of how the heavenly bodies revolve around
          Earth with a specific schedule/time and the retrograde motion of the planets seen through Earth.
          Eudoxus’s model is not representative of how the planets work. Considering the technology at
          the time that Eudoxus created the model, it is a good representation and stepping stone to
          further improve our knowledge of the solar system and the universe. Eudoxus’s model depicted
          the arrangement of the heavenly bodies with accuracy and a few incorrect placements, but for
          the most part, his model is representative of our understanding of the solar system today. His
          model has been improved by other people as well. It is the reason why making a mistake is not
          bad. It is because we can learn from those mistakes and adopt new methods for a better
          understanding of the idea.</p>
        <p class="indent">There is a lot of incorrect things about Eudoxus’s model. The model doesn’t take into
          consideration the variable distance of the heavenly bodies. The brightness of the planets shoulddiffer depending on how far they are from Earth, but Eudoxus’s model doesn’t tackle the
          phenomenon. Instead, the planets are placed in concentric spheres, which should make every
          planet the same brightness wherever it is, which is not the case. The model also depicted that
          the stars are fixed in place in the outermost sphere after Saturn, which is incorrect, and that the
          Earth is also fixed in place and doesn’t revolve like the other planets. It also depicts the Sun in
          the position of Earth. It is the first understanding of the placement of the Earth/Sun because it is
          in the Bible.</p>
        <p class="indent">The Eudoxus Model is not the greatest model of the universe/solar system because of
          the incorrect parts. But it delivered a very detailed explanation of how the planets could have
          worked. The model accounted for the retrograde motion of the planets and stars makes it a
          geocentric solar system wherein Earth is in the middle of the solar system/universe. The model
          has helped and inspired other people to work, experiment, and improve upon Eudoxus’s idea.
          This is how Eudoxus’s planetary model helped shape our understanding of the solar system and
          planetary revolution by providing other people a stepping stone for them to further improve his
          idea. Even if an idea is wrong, it could still be helpful to other people by exploring more on how
          they can improve on an idea by taking notes and inspiration into how the idea was made.
