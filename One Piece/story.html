    <h2>Main Theme</h2>
    <p>
        A major theme in One Piece is dreams. It's the motivating factor of all the Straw Hat Pirates, bar none. Many minor characters have an arc regarding dreams they have or used to have. Nearly all the villians have at least implied that their dreams have been broken in some way. It could be said that, along with The Power of Friendship, One Piece runs on dreams.
        The Straw Hat Pirates all have specific dreams. Luffy wants to be King of the Pirates, Zoro wants to be the World's greatest swordsman, and Nami wants to map the world. Usopp wants to become a great warrior of the sea, Sanji wishes to find the "All-Blue", and Chopper wishes to become the world's greatest doctor, capable of curing all diseases. Finally, there's Robin, who wants to discover the Lost Hundred Years, Franky, who wants to build the world's greatest ship, and Brook, who just wants to see that old sea whale he met so long ago.

    <h2>Pirate Ships</h2>
    <p>
        Pirate ships can have various sizes, reaching from very large examples such as the Moby Dick and Thriller Bark to small rafts, like the one used by the Blackbeard Pirates and the Hitsugibune used by Dracule Mihawk.

        Many pirate ships have figureheads that resemble certain animals (the Going Merry is a prominent example for this). Usually, the motif of the respective pirate flag is printed on the main sail, and the figurehead also reflects the crew's symbol. Due to their combat purpose, almost every pirate ship has several cannons on board.
        
        According to Tom, there are no specific plans for a pirate ship. A ship is a ship, and how it is used by its crew determines whether it is a pirate ship or a marine ship. This was demonstrated when the Going Merry, which was meant to be a personal luxury ship for Kaya, was given to the Straw Hat Pirates, turning it into a pirate ship; or when Krieg first stole a Marine ship and turned it into his first pirate ship, then attempted to take the ocean-going restaurant Baratie into his new flagship.  </p>
        <h2>Marine Ships</h2>

        <p>Marine ships are operated by members of the Marines. Those ships bear the organizations' symbol (a stylized seagull) on their front sails.

            Like pirate ships, there are different types of Marine Ships with varying sizes, though most of them are bigger than the average pirate ship. The Marines also have ice-breakers for reaching islands in colder climates.[10] Furthermore, they have a vast amount of cannons and other weaponry on board. Unlike on most pirate ships, the cannons can be adjusted for a better aiming. The steering wheel is located on the foredeck of the ship.</p>
        
            <h2>Government Ships</h2>

            <p>Government ships are vessels employed by the World Government. They are recognizable by the World Government's insignia (five circles connected by a cross), which they bear on the front sail.

                Government ships are primarily operated by government agents like the Cipher Pol. The World Nobles also travel in those ships, in which case, it may feature a personalized, fancy figurehead. The judicial ships are another example of a government ship, being sea-faring courthouses.</p>

                <h2>Merchant Ships</h2>

                <p>Merchant ships are vessels that tend to carry goods for selling.

                    While no merchant ship has made a proper appearance in the actual story yet, their presence has been mentioned several times. Mont Blanc Noland wrote in his logbook that his crew purchased a Waver from one such ship. Brook also came across a merchant ship during his time with the Rumbar Pirates, buying a tone dial that he eventually used to record the last song his former crew ended up playing before their demise.</p>

                    
                <h2>Cargo Ships</h2>

                <p>Cargo ships are vessels primarily intended to transport large quantities of something.

                    The SAD Tanker belonging to the Donquixote Pirates was an example of such ship, travelling between Punk Hazard and Dressrosa in order to deliver containers of SAD produced in the former island to be refined at the SMILE Factory located in the latter island. The Sea Train Puffing Tom was also originally built for the purpose of facilitating trade between Water 7 and neighboring islands.</p>
                    <h2>Evacuation Ships</h2>

                    <p>An evacuation ship is a vessel intended for times of emergency. Their purpose is to allow civilians within a certain location to escape an incoming threat.

                        The most notable example of an evacuation ship in the series is the one used by the citizens of Ohara as the Buster Call was summoned to destroy their homeland, as a result of the forbidden activities practiced by the country's scholars. Nico Robin was denied access onto the ship due to the other citizens' fear and hatred of her. In a shocking maneuver, the then vice-admiral Sakazuki ordered the destruction of the ship and thus the deaths of everyone aboard, reasoning that one of the island's scholars could have snuck onto the vessel in order to escape.</p>

                        <h2>Ghost Ships</h2>

                        <p>A Ghost Ship (ゴースト船シップ Gōsuto Shippu?) is a ship that is seen sailing the sea without a crew.

                            Several ghost ships have been encountered by the Straw Hat Pirates during their journey at sea. When the Dreadnaught Sabre first returned from the Grand Line, the chefs of Baratie claimed that it looked like a ghost ship due to its damaged state.
                            
                            One ghost ship was a massive vessel that fell from the sky several hundreds of years after the death of its crew. The ship, identified as the St. Briss, was eventually investigated by the Straw Hat Pirates and a salvaging team lead by Masira, leading to the discovery of a map that confirmed the existence of Skypiea.
                            
                            Another ghost ship was encountered upon entrance in the Florian Triangle. This ship was the former ship of the Rumbar Pirates, where all of its crew were dead save one: the former musician Brook, who lived alone due to the power of his Yomi Yomi no Mi reviving him after his death.
                            
                            Immediately after encountering the Rumbar ship, the Straw Hats encountered a "literal" ghost ship called Thriller Bark. Lead by Warlord of the Sea Gecko Moria and his Mysterious Four, the ship was home to a menagerie of creatures including zombies revived by his Kage Kage no Mi and ghosts created from the Horo Horo no Mi of Moria crewmate Perona. Aside from Moria and Perona, Absalom and Doctor Hogback were the only literally living beings on the ship aside from all the victims, zombies and ghosts.
                            
                            While the Flying Dutchman shares the appearance of a ghost ship, and shares the name of a famous real life ghost ship, its crew are very much alive.</p>

    <h2>Main Plot</h2>
    <p>
        On the tiny island of Goa, in the little village of Foosha lived a boy named Monkey D Luffy. Luffy was raised by a combination of his grandfather Garp (a Marine Vice Admiral, responsible for the capture of Roger), the mountain bandit Curly Dadan, and the notorious Pirate Emperor “Red Hair” Shanks. After accidentally eating a magical Devil Fruit known as the Gomu Gomu no Mi (Gum Gum Fruit) Luffy’s body was turned into rubber.
         (All Devil Fruits give the eater incredible abilities but subsequently take away their ability to swim). and having been inspired by Shanks (who gifted him with his Straw Hat), 
        Luffy made a vow to one day become a pirate alongside his brothers Portgas D. Ace, the son of Gol D Roger, and Sabo, the son of a Noble family that had disowned him.
        At the age of 17 Luffy left Goa to pursue his dream of becoming the Pirate King. Not for the treasure, not for the glory, but for the ability to be the most free person in all the world - and so carry on the spirit of ‘Gold’ Roger.
        On his journey he gathered many crew members to help him achieve his dream and to help them achieve their own. They became known as The Strawhat Pirates.
