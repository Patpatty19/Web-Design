    <h2>One Piece: Pirate Warriors</h2>
    <p>
        One Piece: Pirate Warriors[a] is the first installment in the One Piece: Pirate Warriors series, released for PlayStation 3.[4] It was released on March 1, 2012, in Japan, September 21, 2012, in Europe and September 25, 2012, in North America.[5] The game was developed in commemoration of the 15th anniversary of the One Piece manga and anime franchise by Eiichiro Oda. Pirate Warriors was also the first title in the One Piece video game franchise that was released on a PlayStation system since One Piece: Grand Adventure in 2006.
        Pirate Warriors is an action game incorporating elements from both the Dynasty Warriors series and the One Piece series.[3] The game's story mode, Main Log, allows the player to play through the storyline. The Adventure mode uses Luffy to play through the events of the One Piece series and the battle mode allows the player to use characters in battles.[5] In Another Log, the player can play through a character's storyline. With it are several stories exclusive to the game.[6] </p>
        <h2>One Piece: Pirate Warriors 2</h2>

        <p>One Piece: Pirate Warriors 2[b] is the second installment in the One Piece: Pirate Warriors series, released for PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita. It was released in Japan on March 20, 2013, Europe on August 30, 2013 and in the United States on September 3, 2013.
            The game no longer uses a canon story like the original. Instead it uses an original story that take place two years after the Straw Hats Pirates entered the New World. Battles have been changed to focus more on the warrior gameplay, and the player will have to fight through higher numbers of enemies than the previous game. The quick time events from the first game has been removed completely. The game also features a coin system, in which players can spend the money they earn from stages to level up new characters quickly, instead of training them from level 1.

            One noticeable change from the previous game is how support is handled. Players can build up a support gauge throughout gameplay, and use it to go into "Style mode". When in this mode they have the option of temporarily switching characters, and playing as the new character until the support gauge runs out. Style mode also gives a different benefit depending on the characters used: "Armament" characters do more damage when attacking, while "Observation" characters effectively slow down time, while retaining their normal speed.

            <h2>One Piece: Pirate Warriors 3</h2>

            <p>One Piece: Pirate Warriors 3[c] is the third installment in the One Piece: Pirate Warriors series, released for PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita and Microsoft Windows. It was released in Japan on March 26, 2015[8] and subsequently in Western territories on August 25, 2015.[9][10] This is the last One Piece video game released for PlayStation 3. An enhanced port for the Nintendo Switch was released in December 2017.[11]
                The plot of One Piece: Pirate Warriors 3 is very similar to that of the original One Piece series. The game’s story starts with Gol D. Roger’s last words and execution, and then moves onto Red-Hair Shanks giving a young Luffy his straw hat before leaving his hometown. The game summarizes the series’ original storyline with entire arcs being condensed into a single mission, ending with the Dressrosa arc, which has an ending different than original series.[5]

                <h2>One Piece: Pirate Warriors 4</h2>

                <p>One Piece: Pirate Warriors 4[d] is the fourth installment in the One Piece: Pirate Warriors series, released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch.[12] It was released on March 27, 2020.[13][14][15]
                    The game features game play similar to the previous installments.[4] A new game mode called "Titan mode" is introduced, where opponents are actually their size like being really small or being a giant from the anime, forcing the player to adjust their strategy.[5] The game has its own original story that takes the Wano arc from One Piece and changes it.[6] It also features four new multiplayer modes called Giant Boss Battle, Total Bounty Battle, Timed Defense Battle, and Territory Battle .[7]

    <h2>How good is the game?</h2>
    <p>
        One Piece: Pirate Warriors 4 is not only one of the best One Piece games but possibly one of the best Musou games around. Fighting countless hordes of bad guys never got old and proved to be a fantastic way to relieve stress.
